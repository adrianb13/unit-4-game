# unit-4-game

This game is called Crystal Collector
https://adrianb13.github.io/unit-4-game/

You are given a random number to start the game.  4 Crystals are presented to you, each with a random value.  Once you figure out that value, it will not change for that round.  You must use your crystals to match the random number exactly.  If you go over, you lose.  The game will not finish until you meet or exceed the given random number.  Once you win or lose and want to play again, another number will be generated and your crystals will change in value. 

This was created using JavaScript and jQuery.
